However, exaggerated inflammation-due to hyper immune cells activation is detrimental to the host. To curtail this, host is fitted with inherent regulatory loops to bring down the activated immune cell function using a variety of non coding RNAs including micro RNA. In the given project (SOP), a pool of micro RNA will be identified that regulates such immune cell activation in the context of\r\ninflammation associated disorders.",

It is claimed that every third person across the globe carries this pathogen in the latent form but it is highly likely that the subject may never experience any symptom in his/her lifetime. The genetic determinants that lead to the conversion of latent form to the active tuberculosis are not clear. Here, the ME student will be studying various genetic markers that are more (or less) expressed in tuberculosis patients. The list of the genes has been already compiled. We are collaborating with AIIMS Bhubaneshwar for this part of the project. Further, the frequent failure of antibiotic treatment is one of the world’s most pressing public health problems. Such frequent failure is predominantly attributed to the emergence of drug resistance.\r\nIndeed it was not long after the beginning of the antibiotic era that the first resistant organisms appeared1. It is now known that bacteria develop resistance towards most if not all clinically used antibiotics. The student will be getting the opportunity to work on the various proteins involved in multiple drug resistance. We are collaborating with IISER-Bhopal for this part of the project.\r\nWhat student will get? - The student will get the opportunity to learn different biochemical and molecular biology methodologies such as protein purification, western blotting, chromatography, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, DNA gel electrophoresis, RT-PCR and may also work on the clinical samples in the project.\r\nFurther, student will be exposed to various tools of computational biology and bioinformatics.",

Certain coatings with micro and nanoscale patterns can minimize the spreading of low surface energy liquids and split them into tiny droplets, which can easily roll off the surface. The coating based on flexible transparent polymeric substrates may be directly integrated on to touch screen devices.

Since last year in India, direct burning of agriculture residues (wheat straws, rice straws, corncob residues) is observed as a serious air pollution in Delhi reason by releasing many persistent organic pollutants. Lignocellulosic biomass (agricultural residues, woody materials and other plant materials) is the natural source of lignin. It consists of three fractions such as cellulose (40-50%), hemicellulose (20-30%), and lignin (10-25%). Lignin is considered as a major by- product in bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, and in pulp and paper industry. Hence, aim of this research work is to develop a sustainable process for lignin de-polymerization to obtain high yield of value added chemicals and fuels."

Biomass is the only carbon-based renewable energy resource on the planet earth, and it is also capable of producing all kinds of transportation fuels, called biofuel. The triglycerides are thus considered as ideal biomass for the production of diesel-range biofuels. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a promising technology in hydrocarbon biorefinery for eliminating oxygen from triglycerides and producing green diesel with a high yield and negligible loss of carbon. This project thus covers various aspects of HDO of triglycerides (non-edible oil), such as the role of heterogeneous catalyst and supports, and the effect of process conditions on the yield of green diesel."

It determines the domain for a given input text and subsequently Machine Translation can choose its resources as per the identified domain. The task can also be viewed at coarse vs fine grained level based on the requirement.\r\nFor this project, the student is required to develop system/s that automatically identify the technical domain of a given text (a small passage) in specified Langauge (English, Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu).

However, a large number of unscrupulous users are maligning the entire online media by spreading fake healthcare information. This practice, if goes unchecked may cause severe health related issues to a large population world-wide. Thus the tasks of tracking the spread of such misinformation in the internet and checking the spread of such information is of utmost importance for the well-being of the society.\r\nMost of the research in this direction is on data in English language. We wish to explore this problem in the perspective of the Indian languages where it poses several unique challenges.\r\nAs the first step, we need to develop a dataset that consists of blogs and microblogs containing healthcare- related terms in Indian languages scrapped from social media such as Twitter.\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop such a dataset derived from Twitter. The student has to develop a crawler that will crawl the tweets from twitter and filter the data based on the language of the tweet and healthcare-related terms. The challenges involved are as follows:\r\n1. Detection of language is not straight forward since people tend to use the Roman script to write in Indian languages.\r\n2. The words used for a disease in an Indian language may be different from that used in English e.g. 'bukhar' in Hindi is the word for 'fever'. This poses a challenge for detection of domain-specific terms in non-English languages.\r\n3. Incorporation of external knowledge to check for healthcare-related terms in the tweets.",

Smart agriculture in rural areas can largely benefit from the low-power, low- cost sensors and UAVs to sense (soil, temperature, salinity, water, light, insects, pests) and exchange data/images for monitoring and controlling of the crops. India ranks second worldwide in farm output.\r\nThis output can be further increased with the use of technology. After sowing the seeds initially most of the crops just require constant monitoring to check for pests, plant disease etc. This is a task which can be automated using artificial intelligence. In this project, we aim to design a fast, low power computing technology to classify the image captured by agricultural UAVs at the edge/fog devices. In other words, we will propose a hardware architecture that facilitates support for the aforesaid monitoring system using object detection models based on CNN.\r\nNumber of positions: [02]",

This enables doctors as well as patients in making decision process in cancer treatment process.\r\nMethodology: For predicting drug side effects, there is a need to have drug response information. Initially, datasets are collected from different repositories like Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia websites. Some of them are used as training data sets as the input to machine learning techniques. Then, predictive performance of models is evaluated using remaining testing data sets. Further independent validations using clinically relevant data are required to continue bridging the gap between the laboratory and the clinic results.\r\nResults: Different experimental and or mathematical procedures will be used to predict drug response that is drug sensitivity measures. Different analysis levels will be graphically represented in terms of drug response measures (sensitivity Vs resistant) to the breast cancer patient.",

        "ProjectDescription": "Context: Improve the accuracy of GAN model by tuning the hyperparametrs using evolutionary algorithm\r\n.\r\nObjective: This project aims to improve the accuracy of GAN by tune the hyperparameters. GAN is capable of representing social interactions among group nodes of a social network.\r\nSo, in this work, we aim to tune the GAN model to represent the data distribution of interaction changes  of a SN in a graph format. The distribution of the data is analyzed using an optimised function. Analysis of data distribution of the GAN model gives community events of the social network. This distributive value can be analyzed to detect when the pattern is changing from one event to another event.\r\nMethodology: We consider an encoder E that maps input data x to a latent representation z, along with a generator G and discriminator D during training. This enables us to avoid the computationally expensive step of recovering a latent representation at test time. We then define a score function A(x) by using optimization function (Cuckoo search, PSO, and ANT colony) to measure how the event of x is, based on a convex combination of a loss function and a discriminator-based loss function. The loss function demonstrates irregular pattern change in the social network and gives it as a score of the community event change.\r\nResults: Scores of A(x) are used for classifying data into different events of the community and we evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the GAN model to measure the efficiency of the model. Based on the results obtained we will publish research articles and anyone involved in this work will be a co-author.",

However, electrical-power consumption of AWGs is quite high. Newer technologies such as desiccant-based AWGs hold promise since they can be used in conjunction with waste-heat (such as Solar-thermal energy). The student shall (i) explore commercially available AWG technologies, benchmarking parameters and critical numbers such as running cost (due to consumption of electrical power) per liter of water produced as well as initial cost, size of the AWG as well as its capacity (Liters/day), etc (ii) conduct a literature-review of research being conducted on various AWG technologies, especially those that run on low-grade heat and assimilate information regarding the aforementioned benchmarking parameters and critical numbers (iii) formulate an opinion regarding which technology is the most promising and provide recommendations for future research work that may lead to advanced AWGs that are widely adopted in the commercial market for use in various weather conditions (including extremely-dry, desert-like climate) (iv) novel ideas (from the student) for extension/modification of the project are welcome as well: for instance the student can perform a cost-comparison of potable water produced using AWGs and the cost of a mineral water-bottle.",
